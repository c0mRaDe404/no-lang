- symbol table fix(generic type should be added)
- scope
- better hash algo for symbol table
- functions
- arrays and memory pool 
- 

finished:
    - control statements like break,continue (done)
    - for loop (done)


issues:
1.    a < n or a == n (error)
    (a<n) or (a==n) (no error)

2. inline comments not supporting
3. for loop does't seem to stop even after it completed the task
